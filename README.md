# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and Social Media Analytics

This project aims to tackle the growing problem of fake news by leveraging machine learning techniques and social media analytics. By analyzing patterns in data from various sources, the goal is to promote a more informed and resilient society in the digital age.

## Project Detailed Workflow Steps

1. **Collecting Sample Data**: Gather sample fake and true data related to fake news analysis from well-done datasets.
2. **Loading and Analyzing Dataset**: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by cleaning, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing text data to prepare it for modeling.
4. **Splitting Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate machine learning models.
5. **Choosing a Learning Model**: Select a machine learning model, methodology, or schema for training the dataset.
6. **Model Fitting and Prediction**: Fit the selected model with proper parameters and predict the likelihood of news articles being fake or true.
7. **Model Accuracy Score**: Determine the accuracy score of the trained model to assess its performance.
8. **Reporting and Visualization**: Report and visualize the predicted outcomes to gain insights into model predictions.
9. **Model Tuning and Optimization**: If the results are not satisfactory, tune and optimize the model using necessary algorithms.
10. **Testing Optimized Model**: Test the optimized model and report its performance and results.
11. **Iterative Improvement**: If necessary, repeat the optimization process with more efficient techniques to improve model performance.
12. **Summary Report**: Provide a summary report on the models' metrics and visualizations to summarize the project findings.
13. **Testing with Random News Feed**: Test the final model with a random news feed from any source to verify its performance and accuracy in identifying fake news.
